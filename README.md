# Execution-Deterministic Water Surface Dynamics

This repository contains the simulation codes used in the manuscript:

"Execution-Deterministic Water Surface Dynamics via Temporal Recording of Local Direction Alternating Force"

The codes implement a deterministic framework for modeling water surface behavior based on localized force–mass interactions and temporal causal records.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Figure Correspondence
Each script corresponds directly to a figure in the manuscript:

- `Figure_2B_surface_record_dual_source.py`  
  Simulation of surface records generated by dual localized sources.

- `Figure_3_geometric_confinement.py`  
  Surface record formation under geometric confinement.

- `Figure_4A_simulated_water_surface_pattern.py`  
  Simulated surface patterns for side source configuration.

- `Figure_4B_simulated_water_surface_pattern.py`  
  Simulated surface patterns for center source configuration.

- `Figure_S1A_2A_surface_record_single_source.py`  
  Single localized source surface records.

- `Figure_S2_multiple_randomized_localized_event.py`  
  Surface records generated from multiple localized events with randomized initiation times and positions.

- `Figure_S1B_surface_record_single_source.py`  
  Additional single-source surface record examples.

## Notes
The scripts are provided to support transparency and reproducibility of the proposed formulation. 
No additional interaction rules beyond the governing framework are imposed.
